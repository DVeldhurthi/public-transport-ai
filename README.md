# BayRoute 🚆

**BayRoute** is an AI-powered route planning app designed to help students commute safely and efficiently to and from after-school activities across the Bay Area. Inspired by real student experiences, it addresses challenges like multi-agency transfers, confusing schedules, and unexpected delays using real-world transit data from BART and 511. The app uses a **Random Forest machine learning model** to predict delays and recommend routes that prioritize reliability, not just speed. BayRoute integrates multiple transit systems into a single, easy-to-use interface that helps students make better decisions when delays or missed connections happen. Our goal is to make student commuting **smarter, safer, and less stressful**.
